      "The Scenathon Dashboard, created for the FABLE Consortium, represents an innovative platform to explore sustainable futures in food systems and land use.\n\nI was responsible for the planning, design, and frontend development of this project. My objective was to create an intuitive and powerful interface that allows researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to interact in an effective way with the data.\n\nTo develop the dashboard frontend, Tailwind CSS was used to create a cohesive and responsive design. The frontend is powered by React.js, making use of reusable components and allowing the creation of a performant and fast User Experience. To make the visuals more appealing and interesting, the Framer Motion library was used, enriching the experience with a few animations while respecting user preference for reduced motion.\n\nThe most challenging aspect was to create a dashboard that users could interact with while feeling very fast. That was achieved with the use of memoization on the React.js side, but also with the use of the TanStack Query library to fetch, preload, and cache the necessary data.\n\nThe final result is a dashboard that meets the functional requirements of the FABLE Consortium and also offers a fluid and engaging user experience. I believe that a combination of planning and the application of modern technologies like React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion contributed significantly to the platform's potential to facilitate collaboration, data consumption, and decision-making in the sustainable field.",
